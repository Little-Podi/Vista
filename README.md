## Highlight

:bookmark: â€‹**Vista** is a generalizable driving world model that can:

- Predict high-fidelity futures in various scenarios.
- Extend its predictions to continuous and long horizons.
- Execute multi-modal actions (steering angles, speeds, commands, trajectories, goal points).
- Provide rewards for different actions without accessing the ground truth actions.
